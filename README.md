# drop-flutter-otel-sdk

The Shared Flutter OTEL Library — implements `drop_observability`, the shared instrumentation
package designed in `drop-mobile/OTEL_LIBRARY_PLAN.md` (itself derived from
`drop-mobile/OBSERVABILITY_STRATEGY.md` Appendix F). Consumed by `drop-mobile`, `drop-rider`,
and `drop-admin-mobile` as a pinned git dependency.

This repo is named `drop-flutter-otel-sdk`; the Dart package inside it is `drop_observability`
(same repo/package-name split as the `authentication-sdk` precedent).

## Status

L0 (SDK spike), L1 (scaffold + no-op core), L2 (tracing + Dio), L3
(errors), and L5 (export policy) complete. L4 (logs) descoped — see below.
Remaining: L6 (adopt in drop-mobile), L7 (rollout to drop-rider,
drop-admin-mobile).

## L0 — SDK Spike Decision

**Decision: `opentelemetry` (Workiva, pub.dev) — not `dartastic_opentelemetry`.**

Both packages were evaluated empirically (not just from docs) against a local OTEL collector,
per the spike criteria in `OTEL_LIBRARY_PLAN.md`. Reproduction scripts are in `spike/`.

| Criterion | `opentelemetry` (Workiva) 0.18.11 | `dartastic_opentelemetry` 0.9.5 |
|---|---|---|
| **Compiles out of the box** (`pub get` + build, no overrides) | ✅ Yes | ❌ **No.** Its declared constraint `dartastic_opentelemetry_api: ^1.0.0-beta.2` resolves by default to `1.0.0-beta.9`, which doesn't implement `APITracer.timeProvider`/`APITracerProvider.timeProvider` — a compile error. Fixed only by manually pinning `dependency_overrides: dartastic_opentelemetry_api: 1.0.0-beta.2`. This is what any new consumer gets today running `flutter pub add dartastic_opentelemetry`. |
| **OTLP/HTTP export** (spans reach a real `otelcol-contrib`) | ✅ 15/15 spans delivered | ✅ 10/15 delivered (see reliability row) |
| **Batching** (`BatchSpanProcessor`, custom size/delay respected) | ✅ Correct | ✅ Correct (when it doesn't silently drop the tail — see below) |
| **W3C propagation** (inject → carrier → extract, trace ID preserved) | ✅ Verified round-trip | ✅ Verified round-trip, but: `TextMapSetter`/`TextMapGetter` are **not re-exported** from the main `dartastic_opentelemetry` barrel despite the published quickstart only importing that barrel — must import `dartastic_opentelemetry_api` directly. Their `set(key, value)`/`get(key)` shape (carrier bound at construction) also diverges from Workiva's spec-shaped `set(carrier, key, value)`. |
| **Reliability under `forceFlush()`/`shutdown()`** | ✅ All 15 spans arrived. Two transient `ClientException` warnings were logged (see below) but recovered — no data loss. | ❌ **Silently dropped 5 of 15 spans** (the tail batch) even though `forceFlush()` and `shutdown()` both returned normally with no error. This is the single most disqualifying result: `OTEL_LIBRARY_PLAN.md`'s L5 export-policy phase explicitly depends on flush-on-pause being reliable. |
| **Error visibility** | Failures surface via `package:logging`, but **silent unless a listener is attached** (no default sink) — the facade must attach one. | Failures in the dropped-batch case produced **no log output at all** — worse, since there's nothing to attach a listener to. |
| **Binary size delta** (release APK, baseline 42,561,322 bytes) | **+17,688 bytes** (~17 KB) | **+2,658,410 bytes** (~2.6 MB) — **~150x larger**, because it transitively pulls in `google_cloud`, `googleapis_auth`, and `google_identity_services_web`. |
| **Dependency tree / vendor coupling** | Pure OTLP client: `http`, `protobuf`, `grpc`-free. No cloud-vendor deps. | Pulls Google Cloud auth/identity packages transitively, and `OTel.initialize()` accepts `dartasticApiKey`/`tenantId` params — the package is oriented around the author's commercial Dartastic.io SaaS backend, not a neutral OTLP client. Directly conflicts with `OTEL_LIBRARY_PLAN.md` design principle 3 ("keeps the package's dependency tree minimal"). |
| **Maintainer / bus factor** | Workiva (established company, verified pub.dev publisher). GitHub: 87 stars, 26 open issues, actively updated (last push June 2026). | Solo-maintained by Michael Bushe (Mindful Software). Still mid-donation to CNCF as of July 2026 (donation proposal open, not accepted) — same "in-progress" status as when `OBSERVABILITY_STRATEGY.md` was written. |
| **API surface stability** | `opentelemetry (pub.dev 0.9.x)` as named in the original plan is stale — actual latest is **0.18.11**. Still pre-1.0, breaking changes possible, but the package works and its docs/examples are accurate. | Pre-1.0 (`0.9.5`) with a separate pre-1.0-beta API package (`1.0.0-beta.9`) — two independently-versioned pre-1.0 packages that can (and did) drift into an incompatible combination. |

### Why this is decisive, not close

The reliability and compile-integrity findings are the load-bearing ones: a telemetry library
that silently drops the flush-on-pause batch defeats the entire purpose of `OTEL_LIBRARY_PLAN.md`
§5 L5 ("bounded queue... token refresh mid-flight doesn't wedge the exporter"), and a package
that doesn't compile against its own declared dependency range by default is not something to
build a facade on top of today, however active its CNCF donation process. The binary-size and
dependency-tree findings independently violate design principle 3 (no unnecessary vendor
coupling) hard enough to disqualify it even if the reliability issue were fixed.

### Escape hatch

Per the facade rule (`OTEL_LIBRARY_PLAN.md` design principle 1), the OTEL SDK is imported only
inside `lib/src/tracing/tracer.dart`. If `opentelemetry` (Workiva) stalls or regresses, or if
`dartastic_opentelemetry` resolves its compile/reliability issues and completes CNCF donation,
swapping SDKs is a change to that one file plus a package minor/patch bump — no consuming app
code changes, per design principle 1's whole justification.

### Known issues to carry into L1/L2

- Attach a `package:logging` `Logger.root.onRecord` listener inside the facade and route it
  through `AppLogger`/Sentry breadcrumbs — otherwise `CollectorExporter` failures are invisible
  by default (confirmed above).
- The transient `ClientException: Connection closed before full header was received` warnings
  seen under concurrent unawaited exports (multiple batches firing near-simultaneously) — the
  package's retry logic only covers specific HTTP status codes (429/502/503/504), not
  network-level exceptions, which are logged and dropped without retry. Worth a real-device/
  real-network retest in L2, since this was observed against a local Docker collector and may
  be an artifact of this environment's Docker proxy rather than the package itself; either way,
  L5's export policy (bounded queue, drop-oldest) should treat any export failure as expected
  and non-fatal by design, so this is a lower-severity note than the dartastic findings.

## L4 — Logs: Descoped

**Decision: no real OTEL log export for now.** `RingBufferLogger` (L1) — the in-memory
warning+ tail attached to Sentry error events (L3) — remains the only logging backend.
`logging/otel_log_bridge.dart` from `OTEL_LIBRARY_PLAN.md` §4 is not built.

**Why:** `opentelemetry` (Workiva) — the SDK chosen in L0 — has no log-export
implementation at all. `sdk/` has `trace/`, `metrics/`, `resource/` but no `logs/`;
`api/logs/` is an abstract interface plus a no-op stub, and neither is re-exported from
the package's public `api.dart`/`sdk.dart` barrels. This was missed in L0 because the
original spike criteria only covered traces.

A re-spike (`spike/dartastic_logs_probe/`) confirmed `dartastic_opentelemetry` — L0's
disqualified alternative — has a genuinely reliable **logs** pipeline: two clean runs
delivered 15/15 and 16/16 records (vs. its trace pipeline's 33% silent loss), using an
entirely different exporter/processor (`BatchLogRecordProcessor` /
`OtlpHttpLogRecordExporter`). Cross-SDK trace/span correlation — the exact mechanism
this package would need, since spans come from the Workiva tracer, not dartastic's — was
verified empirically too: a `SpanContext` built purely from externally-supplied hex
strings (`OTel.traceIdFrom()`/`OTel.spanIdFrom()`) produced a log record in the collector
carrying those exact IDs.

The blocker isn't reliability — it's that using dartastic *at all*, even logs-only,
reintroduces everything else L0 disqualified it for: the ~2.6 MB transitive Google Cloud
dependency bloat, solo-maintainer risk, and the compile-break requiring a
`dependency_overrides` pin — on top of running two OTEL SDKs side by side. Weighed against
`OBSERVABILITY_STRATEGY.md` Phase 4.5, which already treats logs as the lowest-priority,
off-by-default signal ("measure ingest GB before any always-on decision"), that cost isn't
worth it right now.

**Escape hatch:** if OTEL logs become a real priority later, the two live options are (a)
adopt `dartastic_opentelemetry` logs-only (proven to work, cost is the dependency weight)
or (b) hand-roll a minimal OTLP/HTTP JSON exporter (OTLP/HTTP supports JSON alongside
protobuf, avoiding both the GCP bloat and a second SDK's maintenance risk, at the cost of
owning more code). Neither is blocked technically — this was a scope/cost call, not a
capability gap.

## L5 — Export Policy

`RealDropTracing` no longer uses the SDK's own `BatchSpanProcessor`/`CollectorExporter`
directly. Reading `BatchSpanProcessor`'s source (`lib/src/sdk/trace/span_processors/
batch_processor.dart`) turned up two undocumented behaviors that conflict with
`OBSERVABILITY_STRATEGY.md` Phase 3.4's "bounded in-memory queue, drop-oldest":

- Its queue size is a hardcoded `2048`, not configurable via the constructor.
- On overflow it drops the **newest** span (rejects the incoming one), not the oldest.

`export/export_policy.dart`'s `DropSpanProcessor` is this package's own `SpanProcessor`
implementing the correct drop-oldest, configurable-size policy (default 500, 60s flush
interval — matching the strategy's "batch ≥60s"; the "512KB" byte-size trigger from that
doc isn't implemented, since the SDK has no concept of payload byte size, only span count).

`export/otlp_client.dart`'s `BearerAuthHttpClient` wraps the SDK's `CollectorExporter`
with a custom `http.Client` that re-fetches the token from `ObservabilityConfig.tokenProvider`
on every single request rather than caching it at construction, so a token refresh
mid-flight is picked up on the very next export. A 401 isn't in the SDK's own retry list
(`429/502/503/504`, confirmed by reading `collector_exporter.dart`), so it's already
logged and dropped rather than retried in a loop.

The facade-import allowlist (`scripts/check_facade_imports.sh`) now covers three files —
`tracer.dart`, `export_policy.dart`, `otlp_client.dart` — not just one. All three
implement SDK-required interfaces for the same facade; the invariant that actually
matters (no SDK type in the public API) is unchanged and still enforced.
